We migrated ourodev.com to a new host this year, which is privately run.  The new host offers us more flexibility and hosting options with lower server costs.  Overall, things are running smoothly (barring a few site issues.  Those will be fixed soon ™️ )

We have had 2 major releases this year, Issue 1: From the Ashes, and Issue 2: Foundations of Tomorrow.  We have goals now for Issue 3: finalizing the 64-bit implementation of the entire system, and starting the first steps of the \"Road to Linux\" - PostgreSQL support and the removal of the Windows Registry requirements."
